  <h3>Notable achievements</h3>
  <h4>Designed, built and piloted a custom pod racer. 32 BBY Boonta Eve <br>Classic Race Champion</h4>
  <p>In my spare time at Wald’s Parts junk shop I designed and built a Class III open cockpit Podracer capable of<br>588 mph top speed. Went on to win the Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever win by a  human<br>Generated documented company revenue of over 59 wupiupi during the course of my  enslavement</p>
  <h4>Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction projects</h4>
  <p>During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge of large capital construction projects <br>for the Deep Space Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY by annihilating <br>Alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in the Core Worlds region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire power of <br>the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing both projects to run-away photon <br>torpedoes.</p>
